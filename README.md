# Why

I find myself wanting to play around with Prometheus when integrating into a tool. Normally it's to do with manipulating the data coming out of Prometheus.

This serves as a nice base to build on top of which can then be integrated into the main tool.

It is also super minimal and can almost certainly be pulled into a *Nix workflow if for _some_ reason you need this in your life!
